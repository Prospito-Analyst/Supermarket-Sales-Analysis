# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis

**An Analysis of a Supermarket Sales data**

**📄 Executive Summary**

In the highly competitive retail sector, understanding the intersection of customer demographics and purchasing habits is the key to sustainable growth. This project involved an end-to-end analysis of 1,000 sales transactions from a supermarket chain operating across three major cities.

By analyzing variables such as product line performance, payment preferences, and member vs. normal customer behavior, I identified specific growth levers that could increase the gross income (currently at $15,379) and optimize the average customer rating (6.97/10).

**❓ The Business Problem**

The supermarket chain was operating with a high volume of transactions but lacked a granular view of its profitability and customer satisfaction drivers. 

**Key challenges included:**

**Revenue Stagnation**: Which product lines are the primary drivers of our $322,966 total revenue?

**Customer Loyalty:** Does the "Member" program actually result in higher spend compared to "Normal" walk-in customers?

**Regional Variance:** Why are some branches outperforming others in terms of gross income?

**Operational Timing:** When are the peak hours that require higher staffing to maintain service quality?

**🛠️ The Analysis Methodology**

I executed this project using an approach of Excel for visualization and for data auditing:

**1. Data Auditing & Cleaning**

Processed 1,000 records across 17 attributes (Invoice ID, Branch, Product Line, Unit Cost, etc.).

Verified the calculation of COGS ($307,587) and Gross Income to ensure financial accuracy.

Standardized time formats to allow for hourly trend analysis.

**2. Visualization & Reporting**

Built an interactive Excel Dashboard featuring KPI cards, trend lines, and categorical breakdowns.

**📊 Deep-Dive Insights**

**1. Product Line Performance**

**The Revenue Driver:** **Food and Beverages** and **Fashion Accessories** emerged as the top-performing product lines.

**Profitability Leader:** Health and Beauty generated the highest gross income relative to its volume, signaling a high-margin opportunity.

**The Laggard:** Home and Lifestyle showed the lowest growth potential in the current period.

**2. Customer & Demographic Nuances**

**Loyalty Pays:** **Members** generated **$164,223** in revenue, slightly outperforming Normal customers ($158,743). This validates the effectiveness of the membership program but suggests room for even deeper member engagement.

**Gender Spend Gap:** Female customers generated significantly higher gross income ($7,994) compared to Male customers ($7,384), particularly in the Fashion and Food segments.

**3. Operational Peaks**

**Peak Hours:** The data shows a surge in orders between **1:00 PM – 3:00 PM** and a secondary peak around **7:00 PM – 8:00 PM.**

**Payment Trends**: **E-wallets** are the most popular payment method (345 orders), followed closely by Cash (344 orders).

**🚀 Strategic Recommendations**

**Recommendation 1:** Targeted "Member-Only" Bundles

Why? Members already spend more, but the gap between Member and Normal revenue is narrow.

Action: Introduce exclusive "Member Bundles" for the Food and Beverages line. Increasing the average quantity per member transaction will widen the profitability gap.

**Recommendation 2:** Optimize the "Power Hours"

Why? Peak traffic at 1:00 PM and 7:00 PM creates potential friction at checkout, which may be contributing to the average rating of 6.97.

Action: Increase floor staff and open additional registers during these 2-hour windows to improve the customer experience and drive the rating toward an 8.0 goal.

**Recommendation 3:** Gender-Specific Marketing

Why? Females are the primary drivers of gross income.

Action: Launch targeted marketing for Health and Beauty and Fashion Accessories specifically during the 1:00 PM lunch-hour rush when female foot traffic is at its highest.

**Recommendation 4:** Digital Payment Incentives

Why? E-wallets are already the #1 payment method.

Action: Partner with E-wallet providers for "cashback" incentives. This reduces the burden of cash handling for the supermarket and speeds up the checkout process during peak hours.
